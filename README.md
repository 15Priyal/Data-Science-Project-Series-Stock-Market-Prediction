Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a reliable predictive model for stock market prices using machine learning. The model should be able to forecast future stock values based on historical data, trends, and other relevant factors. The project aims to provide valuable insights and predictions to support decision-making processes in the stock market.

Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast future stock values based on historical stock market data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide accurate predictions that can assist investors and analysts in making informed decisions in the stock market.

Approach:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Load the dataset and understand its structure.
Check for missing values and outliers.
Explore the distribution of stock prices over time.
Visualize key statistics and trends in stock prices using plots such as line charts, histograms, and box plots.
Predictive Modeling:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Select and implement regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
Train the models on the training set and evaluate their performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Documentation:
Create a README file describing the project, dataset, and its features.
Document the EDA process, including visualizations and key findings.
Explain the implementation of regression models and their performance on the dataset.
Provide insights gained from the analysis and potential improvements for future predictions.
